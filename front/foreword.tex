% Feel free to add a quote here that sets the theme for the production of this book. I sometimes write about how I feel about the progress of releasing a new book.\end{myquotation}

This is the first non-technical book I have published, although it includes some technical advice. Most importantly I wanted to capture what I learned about writing during my doctoral studies and I hope you find the book useful if you want to understand scientific writing.

You can reach me through \url{survivejs.com}. I encourage you to get in touch in case you have ideas on how to improve the book or you want to discuss scientific publishing in general.
