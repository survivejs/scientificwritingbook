\chapter{Dedication}\label{dedication:cha}

% \textit{This writing guide has been tailored specifically for my students. It contains personal views, and you should not consider it to be the final word on the topic. Rather, I have captured my experience in this booklet after publishing a dozen scientific papers. In short, it is the kind of information that would have been useful for me to have before I started my efforts toward a doctorate.}

\textit{I want to give my special thanks to my students (too many to mention) for inspiring the work and to akx, tpr, Maurice Forget, Eugene Woo, Pekka Enberg, Anoop Bidikar, Otto Seppälä, and Lauri Savioja for constructive feedback.}
