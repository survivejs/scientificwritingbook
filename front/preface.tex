\chapter{Preface}\label{preface:cha}

The book you are reading was a side effect of pursuing a doctorate as I was given a chance to publish my own scientific papers related to computer science, and more importantly, to work with students. The experience gave me perspective that I used for writing this book. I hope this book helps you in your scientific publishing endeavors!
